## Overview

The Amazon S3 Storage Engine allows developers to store large amounts of unstructured data using the Amazon Web Services S3 service.

## Requirements

To use the Amazon S3 Storage engine, you must have a Amazon Web Services account. You will need to create a programmatic IAM user and provide the __access key__ and __secret key__ to the DBSnapper Cloud Storage Profile page. You will also need to provide the AWS __region__ that you're using for your S3 storage.

Create a bucket in your Amazon S3 account and note the __bucket name__. You can specify an optional bucket prefix that you can use to organize your snapshots.
