## Faster development with sanitized production data

DBSnapper simplifies the process of creating database snapshots from production data that can be used for development and testing. 

DBSnapper is an alternative to creating cumbersome development and test fixtures and allows you to use real production data for your development and testing purposes.

## How it Works
