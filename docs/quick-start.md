title: Quick Start Guide
description: Get started with DBSnapper in minutes - create your first sanitized database snapshot and load it into a development environment.
---

This guide will walk you through creating your first database snapshot with DBSnapper in just a few minutes. You'll learn how to set up the agent, configure a target database, and create a sanitized snapshot for development use.

## What You'll Accomplish

By the end of this guide, you will have:

- âœ… Configured the DBSnapper Agent
- âœ… Connected to a database (source)
- âœ… Created your first database snapshot
- âœ… Loaded the snapshot into a development database

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **DBSnapper Agent installed** - See the [installation guide](installation.md) for setup instructions
- **A source database** - PostgreSQL or MySQL database with sample data
- **A destination database** - Where you'll load the snapshot (can be empty)
- **Database tools** - Either installed locally or Docker available for containerized tools

!!! tip "Need a Test Database?"

    If you don't have a database ready, consider using the PostgreSQL `dvdrental` sample database or MySQL `sakila` database for testing.

## Option 1: Container-Based Quick Start

The fastest way to get started is using the DBSnapper container with DBSnapper Cloud:

```bash
docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -e DBSNAPPER_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key \
  -e DBSNAPPER_AUTHTOKEN=your_auth_token \
  --rm --network dbsnapper --pull always \
  ghcr.io/dbsnapper/dbsnapper:latest \
  dbsnapper build your-cloud-target
```

This approach requires:

1. A [DBSnapper Cloud account](https://app.dbsnapper.com/sign_up) with configured targets
2. Your secret key and auth token from the cloud dashboard

## Option 2: Local Configuration Setup

For local development or when you want full control over configuration:

### Step 1: Initialize Configuration

## Initialize the configuration file

Run the `config init` command to create an example configuration at `~/.config/dbsnapper/dbsnapper.yml`

```sh
dbsnapper config init
```

!!! example "Configuration file initialized to default values"

    ```yaml
    secret_key: d3d234bc83dd4efe7b7329855ba0acc2
    working_directory: /Users/snappy/.dbsnapper
    docker:
      images:
        postgres: postgres:latest
    ```

### Check the configuration and environment

Next, we can check our configuration and required dependencies. This runs some checks to verify the configuration file is valid and reports on the database tools found in the path as well as Docker engine and database image availability.

```sh
dbsnapper config check
```

!!! example "`dbsnapper config check` output"

    ```sh
    Checking DBSnapper Configuration
      âœ… Config file ( /Users/snappy/app/dbsnapper/cli/dbsnapper.yml ) found and loaded
      ðŸ”µ Postgres Local Engine (pglocal)
        âœ… psql found at /Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/latest/bin/psql
        âœ… pg_dump found at /Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/latest/bin/pg_dump
        âœ… pg_restore found at /Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/latest/bin/pg_restore
      ðŸ”µ MySQL Local Engine (mylocal)
        âœ… mysqldump found at /opt/homebrew/bin/mysqldump
        âœ… mysql found at /opt/homebrew/bin/mysql
      ðŸ”µ Postgres Docker Engine (pgdocker)
        âœ… Docker client connected
        âœ… docker.images set in config file
        âœ… docker.images.postgres set in config file
          âœ… Found Docker image: postgres:latest
      ðŸ”µ Mysql Docker Engine (mydocker)
        âœ… Docker client connected
        âœ… docker.images set in config file
        âœ… docker.images.mysql set in config file
          âœ… Found Docker image: mysql:8.0-oracle
      âœ… All supported database engines configured
      âœ… DBSnapper Cloud connected

      âœ… Configuration OK

    ```

### Step 3: Configure Database Targets

Add database connection details to your configuration. A "target" defines both source and destination databases.

Open your configuration file (`~/.config/dbsnapper/dbsnapper.yml`) and add a target definition:

```yaml
targets:
  my_app:
    snapshot:
      src_url: postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/production_app?sslmode=disable
      dst_url: postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/dev_app?sslmode=disable
```

!!! warning "Database Safety"

    The destination database (`dst_url`) will be **completely dropped and recreated** when loading a snapshot. Never use a production database as a destination.

!!! tip "Connection Examples"

    - **PostgreSQL**: `postgresql://user:password@host:port/database?sslmode=disable`
    - **MySQL**: `mysql://user:password@host:port/database`

### Step 4: Verify Target Configuration

List all configured targets and verify connectivity:

```bash
dbsnapper targets
```

This command displays all targets with their connection status and database sizes. The DBSnapper UI provides a clear overview:

![DBSnapper Agent UI - All Targets](static/tui/dbs-ui-all-targets.png "DBSnapper Agent UI showing all configured targets")

### Step 5: Create Your First Snapshot

Build a snapshot of your source database:

```bash
dbsnapper build my_app
```

This command:

- Connects to your source database using the configured `src_url`
- Creates a database dump using native tools (`pg_dump` for PostgreSQL, `mysqldump` for MySQL)
- Stores the snapshot in your working directory
- Optionally uploads to cloud storage if configured

!!! tip "Snapshot Naming"

    Snapshots are automatically timestamped and indexed. You can also add custom tags or descriptions.

### Step 6: View Available Snapshots

List all snapshots for a specific target:

```bash
dbsnapper target my_app
```

This shows detailed information about each snapshot including size, creation time, and status:

![DBSnapper Agent UI - Target Snapshots](static/tui/dbs-ui-target-snapshots.png "DBSnapper Agent UI showing snapshots for a target")

### Step 7: Load a Snapshot

Load the most recent snapshot (index 0) into your destination database:

```bash
dbsnapper load my_app 0
```

!!! danger "Destructive Operation"

    The destination database will be **completely dropped and recreated**. Ensure you're not targeting a production database.

## Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰

You've successfully created and loaded your first database snapshot with DBSnapper. Your development database now contains a sanitized copy of your production data.

## Next Steps

### Automation & Integration

Integrate DBSnapper into your workflows:

- **[GitHub Actions](articles/dbsnapper-github-actions-ecs-simplified.md)** - Automated CI/CD snapshots
- **[VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbsnapper.vscode-dbsnapper)** - In-editor snapshot management
- **[Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/dbsnapper/dbsnapper/latest)** - Infrastructure as Code

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

**Connection Problems**: If `dbsnapper targets` shows connection errors, verify:

- Database credentials and network connectivity
- Database server is running and accepting connections
- SSL/TLS settings match your database configuration

**Missing Tools**: If `dbsnapper config check` reports missing tools:

- Install database tools locally (`postgresql-client`, `mysql-client`)
- Or use Docker-based engines (recommended for consistency)

**Permission Errors**: Ensure the DBSnapper user has:

- `SELECT` permissions on source database
- `CREATE DATABASE` permissions on destination server
